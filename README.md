# toy_robot

## Running

On Unix type systems, run with:

    bin/toy_robot command-filename


See the [Cucumber feature](https://github.com/ritchiey/toy_robot/blob/master/features/toy_robot.feature) for example runs.

## Implementation

This implementation follows the imperative shell, functional core methodology described by [Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries). This
enabled me to test the robot simply and without mocks or stubs.
